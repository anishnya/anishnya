Hi, my name is Anish Nyayachavadi. I'm a C.S Ph.D student at the University of Washington's SysLab. My current research interests are in Networking and Systems. During my free time, I enjoy contributing to open source projects (@arrow-py) and pursing research interests in the area of distributed systems.
