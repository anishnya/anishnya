Hi, my name is Anish Nyayachavadi. I'm a graduate student studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan. Currently I'm a Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) at the University of Michigan. During my free time, I enjoy contributing to open source projects (@arrow-py) and pursing research interests in the area of distributed systems.
